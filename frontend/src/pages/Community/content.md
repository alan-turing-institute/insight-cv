## Slack workspace
Please [join our Slack workspace](https://forms.office.com/e/cW28TK4aui) 
to stay up to date with the Scivision community! You can use Slack to:
-   Discuss computer vision in the sciences and humanities
-   Get help with computer vision methods, and helping others
-   Get support using the Scivision catalog and software
-   Share and discover interesting events

We aim for this to be a welcome and supportive place to discuss
computer vision, share ideas and ask questions. Using (or even
intending to use) the Scivision software is not a prerequisite for
joining!

## Image Analysis Across Domains meeting
When: Every other Tuesday, 10 am UK time, 1 hour

These meetings focus on the field of computer vision in any / all domains. The aim of the meetings 
is to discuss our research projects, talk about image analysis methods, and share ideas. 
Everyone is welcome to attend.

Typically the meeting has two parts. During the main 45 minute slot, a presenter leads on some aspect 
of computer vision. This part can take many formats, for example a presentation on your research work 
followed by a discussion, an exploration of a problem that you would like feedback on, a discussion on 
a method / paper you are interested in, a talk by an invited speaker, or anything else that you think 
would be useful / interesting. The last 15 minutes are for anyone to raise any specific questions /
problems they have. This can be scheduled in advance or be more impromptu.

These meetings are organised by the Scivision team, but there is no requirement for you to have worked 
with Scivision or to be based at the Turing to take part.

If you would like to find out more / volunteer to give a talk, then join our Slack channel (using the link above to sign up).

## Slack workspace
Please [join our Slack workspace](https://forms.office.com/e/cW28TK4aui) 
to stay up to date with the Scivision community! You can use Slack to:
-   Discuss computer vision in the sciences and humanities
-   Get help with computer vision methods, and helping others
-   Get support using the Scivision catalog and software
-   Share and discover interesting events

We aim for this to be a welcome and supportive place to discuss
computer vision, share ideas and ask questions. Using (or even
intending to use) the Scivision software is not a prerequisite for
joining!

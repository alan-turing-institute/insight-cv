`scivision` aims to be a well-documented and generalisable Python framework for applying computer vision methods to a wide range of scientific imagery.

This tool aims to foster collaboration between **data owners** and **developers** by:
* Empowering scientific domain experts to easily access and integrate the latest CV tools
* Enabling algorithm developers to distribute their tools to users across scientific fields
* Evolving with a focus on the needs and priorities of both developers and users
* Creating and maintaining a community of interdisciplinary contributors
* Providing a bridge between different data scales and formats

## üê® Installation

1. **Install scivision via [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/scivision/)**: which tends to be the most user-friendly option:

    ```bash
    pip install scivision
    ```

    * Explore the [examples folder](./examples) which contains Jupyter Notebooks showing how different components in scivision can be run. 

    You can install `Jupyter` by:

    ```bash
    pip install jupyter
    ```

2. **Install scivision from the source code**:

    * Clone scivision source code:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/scivision.git 
    ```

    * Install scivision and its dependencies:

    ```bash
    cd /path/to/my/scivision
    pip install -v -e .
    ```

## ü§î Contributing

See the [Contributing Guide on readthedocs](https://scivision.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html), which contains information on how to set up and contribute computer vision models and scientific image datasets to the scivision catalog, and make them available via the scivision python API, as well as modify the source code.

You may consider starting or joining in with a [discussion](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/scivision/discussions), or opening an [issue](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/scivision/issues) in this GitHub repo.

## üìö Documentation

In in addition to the Contributing Guide, the [readthedocs](https://scivision.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) website contains information about using the scivision python package API and updating the scivision catalog.

It also includes our maintainer documentation, which explains how to update the scivision package on PyPI and update the documentation.

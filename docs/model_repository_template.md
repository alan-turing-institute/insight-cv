# Scivision model repository template

In order for `scivision` to be able to load and run a computer vision model, a GitHub repository containing configuration for the model must first be creeated. This is also a pre-requisite for adding the model to the scivision "catalog", enabling other users of scivision to be able to use it.

To be included in the repository are the following:

-  `scivision-model.yml` configuration file
- setup.py
- requirements.txt

Optional:
- test data dir

# Scivision model repository template

In order for `scivision` to be able to load and run a computer vision (CV) model, a GitHub repository containing configuration for the model must first be created.

This guide explains how to set up a GitHub repository for your CV model(s) compatible with scivision.

To be included in the repository are the following:

-  `scivision-model.yml` configuration file
- `setup.py` to enable the model to be installed via pip
- the model code, or a script that imports the model from elsewhere

This is also a pre-requisite for adding the model to the scivision "catalog", enabling other users of scivision to use it. To learn how to do this, consult the [contributor page](../contributing.md#gift-extending-the-scivision-catalog) after setting up your model as per this guide.

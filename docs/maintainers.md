.. _releasing:

## üêç Python package releases

Developers of `scivision` with maintainer access to https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/scivision & https://pypi.org/project/scivision can release a new version of the package with the following steps:

1. On a new branch of the `scivision` repo, increment the `version` in `setup.py` and any other metadata that differs for the new release.

2. Make sure you have a working python 3 installation. Check your version with:
    
    ```bash
    python --version
    ```
3. Install these packages if you don't have them:

   ```bash
   pip install build twine
   ```
4. Build the release:

   ```bash
   python -m build
   ```
5. Upload the release, substituting `<version>` with the new version number:

   ```bash
   python -m twine upload dist/<version>*
   ```
    * Note: You'll need to provide your PyPi username and password
6. Commit changes to `setup.py` and pull request to the `main` branch of https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/scivision

.. _building:

## üìì Build scivision documentation

Maintainers of this `readthedocs` site can build and view the docs by doing the following:

1. Make sure you have a working python 3 installation. Check your version with:
    
    ```bash
    python --version
    ```

2. Clone https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/scivision and install requirements:
  
  ```bash
  pip install -r docs/requirements.txt
  ```

3. Build the docs:
  * In the top dir of the repo:
  
  ```bash
  sphinx-build -b html docs/ build/
  ```
  * The HTML will  be created in `build/`

4. Update the API documentation:
  * Edit (or add) to the docstring of the function in question
  * Ensure that the module containing that function has been added to `docs/api.rst`
  * Open `build/index.html` in a browser to view edits
5. Push the updates to the readthedocs site:
  * Create a pull request with your changes
  * A build of the docs should be triggered
  * You can also log into the https://readthedocs.org/projects/scivision/ dashboard as a maintainer and click `Builds->Build Version`
